## Dependencies:
Needs [Itemscroller](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/item-scroller), [MaLiLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/malilib), and [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) \
<sup><sub>Also works with the ports found on kosma.pl/masamods/ if you need Tweakeroo or Litematica as well</sub></sup>

## Usage:
Click a recipe, press and hold the key combo bound to `recipeBookMassCraft`, which is `ctrl`+`q` by default

To change the key combo, press `I`+`C`, click `Hotkeys` and search for `recipeBookMassCraft`

## Note about this mod:
`boyenn#3717` made this thing, released it as a dev build in a few discord servers, but never worked on it further.

This mod is 100% based on `boyenn#3717`'s port, with the intermediary mappings translated to 1.19 Yarn mappings.

## Who came up with recipe book mass craft???

Boyenn says he ported this feature from the 1.12.2 itemscroller, but according to Masa (ItemScroller Dev and Literal God), this feature isn't in 1.12.2 itemscroller.

I have literally no idea where this idea originated, just know I did my best to give proper credit.
